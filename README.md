Identifying handwritten digits using Logistic
Regression in PyTorch

Handwritten digit classification is a fundamental problem in the field of machine
learning and computer vision. In this report, we explore the implementation of
logistic regression for classifying handwritten digits using PyTorch. Logistic
regression serves as a simple yet effective baseline model for this task.
Logistic Regression is a very commonly used statistical method that allows us to
predict a binary output from a set of independent variables. We shall find out
how to implement this in PyTorch, a very popular deep learning library that is
being developed by Facebook.
Now, we shall see how to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset
using Logistic Regression in PyTorch.
Dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
For this project, we utilize the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark
dataset for handwritten digit classification. The dataset consists of 28x28
grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and contains 60,000 training
samples and 10,000 test samples.

Analysis
In this report, we presented the implementation of logistic regression for
classifying handwritten digits using PyTorch. While logistic regression serves as a
basic model for this task, it lays the foundation for exploring more sophisticated
deep learning architectures in future work. We got an accuracy of 82%, which is
far off from todayâ€™s state-of-the-art model, which uses a special type of neural
network architecture.
Overall, the report effectively communicates the process of classifying
handwritten digits using logistic regression in PyTorch. It demonstrates a
structured approach to problem-solving and analysis while also highlighting
areas for future research and improvement. However, providing more detailed
results and explanations could enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of
the report.
